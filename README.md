# CMPSC-311-Group-Project

Hello hi yes this is our github repository for the CMPSC 311 group project. 
   
### Problem prompt 
Students are required to create a **chat application in C** following the client/server architecture and the concepts of socket programming.\
The chart application should support **multiple users** who can join the chat room.\
If a user sends a message, everyone in the chatroom should receive the message.
   
### What we need to submit
The application should be built with three main components:
* **Server class**
* **Communication class**
* **Client app/component**<br/>

The application should enable multiple clients to send/receive messages simultaneously.<br/> 
The client interface should be GUI. However, **console-based UI** will also be acceptable.
